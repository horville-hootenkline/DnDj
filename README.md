# DnDj

**A  multi-featured (and system agnostic) sound mixer for [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com).**

DnDj is designed to give the GM detailed control over what is being played and heard.

**Features at launch include -**

- cross fade tracks over variable times. 

- live volume control.

- master and personal volume control.

- pause.

- mute.

- automatically sync everyone to the same time elapsed on all tracks. 

- Session memory - the ability to load your last mix.

**Upcoming features -**

- full featured seek within tracks.

- monitoring: allowing the GM to audition tracks and volume changes without the players hearing them.

- control who hears what e.g resolve a passive perception check with Alex hearing the orcs but not Maggie and Brian. 

- save multiple sessions and load them on the fly, allowing a GM to seamlessly mix between presets for locations, situations or characters. This would result in...

- A console for programming sessions, cues, transitions etc.

**Possible future features -**

- A soundboard.

- A satelite mixer for players e.g Maggie is all about the atmos Alex on the other hand wants to drown in the addrenaline on endless synths and war drums. 


## NOTES - given the intricate nature of this module, its numerous possible states and the inherently disruptive nature of a sound error - this thing is going to be woobly for a while.
